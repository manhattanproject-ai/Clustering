# How to determine the cut-off line in hierarchical clustering

The cut-off line in hierarchical clustering, which determines the final number of clusters (K), is typically determined by a combination of visual inspection of the dendrogram and considering the application's specific needs or constraints.

The primary methods are:

## 1. Visual Inspection of the Dendrogram ðŸŒ²
This is the most common and intuitive method, relying on finding the largest gaps in the hierarchy.

* Find the Longest Vertical Lines: Look for the largest vertical distances (dissimilarities) that have not yet been traversed by a horizontal merger line. These gaps represent points where the clusters are most naturally 
separated.
* Set the Cutoff: Draw a horizontal line (the cutoff) that intersects the dendrogram branches within the height of these large gaps.
* Determine K: The number of vertical lines the cutoff line intersects determines the final number of clusters (K).

Example: In the image above , the red dashed line is set at a certain Cluster distance that results in four distinct clusters (Orange, Green, Cyan, Yellow), as it crosses four main branches.


## 2. Using an Absolute Distance Threshold
If you have domain knowledge, you can set a specific distance threshold based on what constitutes "similar" for your application.

* Fixed Threshold: Choose a fixed distance value $D_{cutoff}$ on the vertical axis.
* Interpretation: Any data points or groups merged below this line are considered part of the same cluster, while groups merged above this line remain separate.
* Scenario: If clustering customers based on the distance between their weekly spend and site visits, you might decide that a "distance" greater than 50 units (e.g., D>50) means the customers are fundamentally different, and
you set your cutoff there.

## 3. Defining a Target Number of Clusters (K)
If the business problem requires a specific number of groups, you can work backward from K.

* Target K: If you need exactly K=3 clusters, you simply move the horizontal cutoff line down from the top until it intersects exactly three vertical branches.
* Use the Dendrogram: You use the dendrogram to find the precise distance that yields the required K, allowing you to see which clusters are merged last to form Kâˆ’1 groups.

In essence, the choice of the cutoff line is a trade-off between having a few large, highly dissimilar clusters (cutting high up) and many small, highly similar clusters (cutting low down).
