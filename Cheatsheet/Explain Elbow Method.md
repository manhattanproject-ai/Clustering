The Elbow Method is a heuristic technique used to determine the optimal number of clusters (K) for K-means clustering. Since K-means requires the number of clusters to be specified beforehand, the Elbow Method provides a systematic way to select the best K.

## Intuition
The core idea is to plot the clustering quality (measured by WCSS) against the number of clusters (K) and look for the point of diminishing returns.

* WCSS always decreases: As you increase the number of clusters (K), the Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS) will always decrease. When K equals the number of data points, WCSS becomes 0 (since each point is its own perfect cluster).
* The "Elbow": The method involves finding the value of K where the decrease in WCSS starts to slow down significantly, forming an "elbow" shape on the plot.
* Optimal K: This "elbow" point is generally considered the optimal number of clusters, as adding more clusters beyond this point does not provide a substantially better grouping of the data.

## Example
Imagine we are testing K values from 1 to 11 for a dataset, and we calculate the WCSS for each run.

|K (Number of Clusters)|	WCSS Error|	Change in WCSS (from previous K)|	Observation|
|--------|---|---|---|
|1|	500|	N/A|	Highest WCSS (no clusters)|
|2|	200|	-300|	Large decrease in error|
|3|	100|	-100|	Significant decrease|
|4|	30|	-70|	The biggest "bend" or "elbow" point.|
|5|	25|	-5|	Very small decrease|
|6|	22|	-3|	Negligible decrease|

## Conclusion
In this example, the WCSS drops drastically from K=1 to K=2 and K=3. The drop between K=3 and K=4 is still quite large, but the subsequent drop from K=4 to K=5 is significantly smaller (only 5 units).

Therefore, K=4 is the optimal number of clusters according to the Elbow Method, as it's the point where adding another cluster no longer provides a strong justification for the added complexity.
